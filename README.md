# FlaskAppUTest

- Unittesting project for Python Rest API Flask based

- This project is using Python 3.6.9, which may sometimes be an issue while using latest OS's.
In-case if you are facing issues with the Python version, the GitHub code will work with Python 3.8.0 also.
So you need to install that version with cmd: pyenv install 3.8.0
And, in the jenkins script just replace 3.6.9 with 3.8.0.
pyenv global 3.8.0
